                            <p>With millions of supporters marching, organizing, and showing solidarity, the Black
                                Lives Matter movement may have become the largest movement in U.S. history, as
                                reported by The New York Times. And this fight for social justice is happening at
                                the same time as people across the world navigate being isolated and distanced from
                                one another due to the pandemic.
                                If you know how to code, that skill can allow you to support social justice
                                movements, although that may come as a surprise. When you think of activism you
                                probably envision protesting in the streets and not sitting at a computer. But with
                                tech skills, you’re uniquely poised to have an impact during a time of global crisis
                                and reckoning.
                                You don’t have to have decades of experience or a full-time job in tech to have an
                                impact. Even if you are currently learning to code or in the process of making a
                                career change into tech, you can play a role in fighting for social justice.
                                As a software developer myself, I’ve been digging into what it means to use tech
                                skills to contribute to social justice, and racial equality in particular. I’m
                                sharing with you my ongoing research on how to use your skills as a developer to
                                participate in social justice movements.
